When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

For instance, when you are part of a team working together on the same project, or if you work from different computers and want to keep them synchronized.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 To make logical units be updated. 
 Make visible to other people stable versions

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branch are applied on a local repository in order to keep different versions. Clones are a local copy of a repository either local or remore. 
And finally, forks are clones within GitHub

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can roll back just in case you have commited some errors. You can work offline for some time.
